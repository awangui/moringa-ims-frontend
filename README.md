# Moringa IMS Frontend

## Project Overview
Moringa School requires a robust and efficient Inventory Management System (IMS) to track and manage assets within the institution. This system will enable accurate monitoring of items, including borrowing, returning, and identifying assets through barcodes or QR codes. The proposed solution aims to streamline inventory operations, reduce manual errors, and improve asset accountability.

## Objectives
- Implement a microservice-based architecture to manage and track inventory.
- Enable borrowing and returning of items with proper logs.
- Support asset identification using barcodes and QR codes.
- Allow users to add, update, and delete items within the inventory.
- Enable item conversions to track unit changes (e.g., boxes to individual items).
- Implement multi-user, role-based access control for security and operational efficiency.
- Generate reports on asset status and usage.

## System Features

### Item Management
- Add, update, and delete items in the inventory.
- Categorize assets based on type (e.g., laptops, projectors, lab equipment).
- Support item conversions (e.g., from bulk units to individual items).

### Borrowing and Return System
- Record borrowing and returning transactions.
- Assign items to specific users with due dates.
- Send reminders for overdue returns.

### Barcode/QR Code Integration
- Generate barcodes/QR codes for new assets.
- Scan barcodes/QR codes to retrieve or update asset details.

### Reporting and Analytics
- Track asset usage, availability, and location.
- Generate reports on borrowed items, overdue returns, and asset lifespan.

### Multi-User and Role-Based Permissions
- Implement user roles with specific access levels.
- Ensure data security by restricting actions based on user roles.

## Technical Approach

### Microservice Architecture
- Authentication (permission management)
- IMS (rest of the app)

### Frontend
- React.js for a user-friendly interface.

### Backend
- Node.js/Flask for robust APIs and business logic.

### Database
- PostgreSQL for structured data storage.

### Barcode/QR Code
- Integration with libraries for code generation and scanning on mobile app.

## Expected Outcomes
- Efficient asset tracking and management on multiple spaces.
- Reduced losses through detailed borrowing logs.
- Streamlined inventory audits with automated reporting.
- Improved security through role-based permissions.
- Enhanced accuracy with item conversions.
- Increased scalability and maintainability through microservice architecture.

## Conclusion
The proposed Inventory Management System will provide Moringa School with a reliable, efficient, and scalable solution to manage its assets effectively. By incorporating advanced tracking technologies, a microservice architecture, and automated workflows, the system will ensure better accountability and improved operational efficiency.
